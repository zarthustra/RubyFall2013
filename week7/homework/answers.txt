Questions:
1. What is method_missing and how can it be used?

method_missing is a hook method that can be used to invoke a callback given specific conditions. It can be useful when there is an undefined method that will be plugged in later, as it allows the program to ignore those calls.

2. What is and Eigenclass and what is it used for? Where Do Singleton methods live?

An Eigenclass is an anonymous class that is used to contain Singleton methods. The original class becomes a superclass, and the Singleton methods 'live' within that anonymous class.

3. When would you use DuckTypeing? How would you use it to improve your code?

DuckTyping is used when the focus is on what the function of the code is, rather than what the code literally is. It is essential in any object-oriented language, where objects should be defined by their purpose rather than their state of being.

4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?

A class method is a method that is used on a class that cannot be used on an instance. Instance methods are similarly constrained.

Somewhat counterintuitively, instance_eval is used to define class methods, while class_eval is used to define instance methods.

5. What is the difference between a singleton class and a singleton method?

A singleton class is where the methods (either singleton or instance) are defined, and a singleton method interacts with a specific object.
